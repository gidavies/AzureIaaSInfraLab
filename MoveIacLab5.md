# Lab 5: IaaS Automation

This lab will cover automating the provisioning of infrastructure as part of a continuous delivery pipeline using Azure DevOps.

This lab needs tailoring to follow on from the existing labs but in the meantime this lab can be used:

[Deploying UK Official IaaS Reference Architecture using ARM Templates and Azure DevOps](https://github.com/gidavies/AzureDevOps-UKGovRefArch)

[Lab 4: Failover between regions](https://github.com/gidavies/MovingToInfraAsCodeLab/blob/master/MoveIacLab4.md)
